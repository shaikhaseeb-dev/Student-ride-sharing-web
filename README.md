## üöÄ Getting Started Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Git Version Control
* A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account or a local MongoDB server instance.

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shaikhaseeb-dev/Student-ride-sharing-web.git](https://github.com/shaikhaseeb-dev/Student-ride-sharing-web.git)
    cd Student-ride-sharing-web
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    A `requirements.txt` file is included to streamline installation.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    For security, the application configuration is managed through environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the project's root directory.

    Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided) or use the template below:
    ```ini
    # .env file
    SECRET_KEY='generate-a-strong-random-secret-key-here'
    MONGO_URI='your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string'
    ```
